## INTRODUCTION
Milo Yatri is a social travel webapp that rapidly links you with other travellers in your
area who are keen to visit new places. A fantastic real-time networking tool for
locating nearby hiking destinations and travelling companions. The app is designed to
be user-friendly and to work on a variety of mobile and tablet devices with varied
screen sizes. It includes details about the points of interest as well as a city map. Milo
Yatri is not only wonderful for backpackers and solo travel, but it's also a
comprehensive traveller’s community that can help motivate people who would
otherwise be hesitant to travel alone. Enter a date and city, and the app will display all
travellers who are travelling at the same time. The results will show you their interests
and if they match yours you can plan to meet or travel together. This feature can be a
handy aid in helping to eliminate the fear of travelling alone. This social travel app is
also a great platform for single female travellers to connect with other female travel
companions nearby, plan meetups and have a safe and pleasant travel experience.
